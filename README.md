# F1 Teams (very inspired by Tesla website)

Welcome to this little project called F1 Teams.

My goal for this project was to build a single page application using TailwindCSS for the first time.
Until now, I've only worked with CSS Vanilla and SASS, so I've decided to learn a CSS framework.

As a Formula 1 enthusiast, I've though it would be a great idea to build a simple page application mixing an existing website ([Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)) and something that I enjoy.
